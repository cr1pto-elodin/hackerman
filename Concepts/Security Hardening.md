This is the process of strengthening a system to reduce its vulnerability and attack surface. The job of cybersecurity analyst is to make the system the most secure as it can be. There are ways to do it, such as configuring rules in the OS, the network or even the cloud environment.

## Security Measures

- **Patch update**: A software and operating system update that addresses security vulnerabilities within a program or product
- **Baseline configuration**: A documented set of specifications within a system that is used as a basis for future builds, releases and updates
- **Multi-factor Authentication**: A security measure which requires a user to verify their identity in two or more ways to access a system or network
- **Salting and hashing**: The hashing can convert informations to a single value that can be used to determine its integrity. This is a unidirectional function, which means that's impossible to decrypt and obtain the original text.
- **CAPTCHA** and **reCAPTCHA**: CAPTCHA means Completely Automated Public Turing test to Tell Computers and Humans Apart. It requests the users to conclude a simple test that verifies that they're really humans. The reCAPTCHA is a Google service that helps protecting sites against bots and malicious softwares.
