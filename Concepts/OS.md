This article will be responsible for gathering some core concepts about operational systems. The **operating system** is the interface between the hardware and the user. In general, OS have the following key features:

- **Resource Management**: Allocates and manages hardware like CPU, memory and storage.
- **Process Management**: Controls the execution of programs and ensures they don't interfere with each other.
- **File system management**: Organizes and stores data on the computer's storage devices.
- **User Interface**: Provides a way for users to interact with the computer, such as through a graphical user interface (GUI) or command-line interface (CLI).
- **Security**: Protects the system from unauthorized access and malicious software.



## Kernel

This is the core component of the **operating system**. It's responsible for managing process and memory. It has features such as:

- **Hardware Abstraction**: Provides a consistent interface for software to interact with different devices.
- **Process Management**: Manages the execution of processes, including scheduling, memory allocation and inter-process communication.
- **Memory Management**: Allocates and deallocates memory to processes as needed.
- **Device driver management**: Controls the interaction between the operating system and hardware devices.
- **File system management**: Provides access to files and directories on storage devices.
- **Security**: Enforces security policies and protects the system from unauthorized access.

### Kernel and OS

- The kernel is crucial part of the operating system, but it's not the entire OS
- The OS includes other components like the user interface, shell, and various utilities.
- The kernel is responsible for the low-level operations, while the rest of the OS provides a user-friendly interface and additional features.
