Anything that can impact the confidentiality, integrity or availability of an asset. A formula to determine the level of the risk defines that: the risk level is equal to the possibility of an attack.

There are many factors that can affect the probability of a risk to an organization assets:

* **External Risk**: Anything outside of the organization that has the potential to damage organizational assets, like threat agents that can obtain access to private informations.
* **Internal Risks**: An employer, supplier or trusted partner, old or new, that represents a risk.
* **Legacy systems**: Legacy systems that can't or can be updated, but still can impact the assets, like old work stations or old mainframe systems.
* **Multi-part risk**: Third party workers can have access on intelectual property, such as comercial secrets, software projects and creations.
* **Accordance/software licensing**: Software that is not updated or in accordance, or even patches that are not installed just in time.

Risks also can be ranked as:

* **Low-risk asset**: Information that would not harm the organizations reputation or ongoing operations, and would not cause financial damage if compromised
* **Medium-risk asset**: Information that's not available to the public and may cause some damage to the organization's finances, reputation, or ongoing operations.
* **High-risk asset**: Information protected by regulations or laws, which if compromised would have a severe negative impact on an organization's finance, ongoing operations or reputation.

# Web Risks

The [OWASP](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) publish and lists the most critical risks to web applications. They have, also, trainings based on these types of risks, that emulates real life scenarios such as websites like [JuiceShop](https://owasp.org/www-project-juice-shop/).

They categorize the threats as:

1. **Broken-Access Control**
2. **Cryptographic Failures**
3. **Injection**
4. **Insecure Design**
5. **Security Misconfiguration**
6. **Vulnerable and Outdated Components**
7. **Identification and Authentication Failures**
8. **Software and Data Integrity Failures**
9. **Security Logging and Monitoring Failures**
10. **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**
