Any circumstance or event that can negatively impact assets. As an analyst, my job will be to defend the organization's assets against internal and external threats. These two can de defined as:

* **Advanced Persistent Threats (APT)**: A threat agent that maintains unauthorized access to a system for a long period of time.
