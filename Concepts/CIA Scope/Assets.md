Remember: `You can only protect what you have`

With this in mind, **process management** is the process of monitoring assets and risks that would affect them. And an asset is anything that belongs to someone or to an organization. Among cyber security practices, one really important is the process to categorize **assets** ou count them. Even before that, we need to see what type it belongs too:

- Digital assets, data like client data or financial records
- Information about systems that process data
- Physical resources, such as buildings, equipments or supplies
- Intangible resources, like branding reputation or intelectual property

The way to categorize an **asset** is to think about how important and sensitive it is to the organization. When an analyst does it, they need to categorize thinking about the following patterns:

- What do you have
- Where do you have it
- Who owns it
- What is it importance

Following this thought, there's the common categorization of an **asset**:

- **Restrict**: Grave consequences if this kind of asset is exposed. Examples can be intelectual property.
- **Confidential**: The exposure of these assets will lead to bad consequences to the organization.
- **Internal**: Assets that are only available to employees and business partners.
- **Public**: These assets, if exposed, won't bring bad consequences to the organization.
