	CSSIP has defined eight domains that can be used as areas of
	work among cyber security professionals. The're often looked
	as areas to specialize in, because even though someone can be
	a generalist, usually it specializes somewhere in their career.

The eight domains can be specified as:

* **Security and [[Risks|risk]] management**: This area has the focus in more corporate concepts as defining security goals and objectives, risk mitigation, compliance, business continuity and even the law. One example of this is that a security team can change the way the company treats PII to adhere with the GDPR.
* **Asset security**: This area focus on securing digital and physical assets. It's also related to the storage, maintenance, retention and disposal of data. For example, a team can create regular backups from databases, to ensure that if an incident occurs, the damage will be reduced.
* **Security Architecture and Engineering**: Focus on optimizing data security by ensuring effective tools, systems and process are in place. For example, as a security analyst you can be tasked with configuring a firewall or implement the use of a SIEM tool, to monitore unusual logins or user activity that can indicate that a [[Threats|threat]] agent is trying to access private data.
* **Communication and Network Security**: Focus in managing and securing physical networks and wireless communication. For example, you can be tasked to see the behavior of users and get that they're accessing sensitive data from wireless suspicious points. 
* **Identity and Access Management**: It focuses on keeping data secure, by ensuring users follow company policies to control and manage physical assets, like office spaces, and logical assets, as networks and applications. 
* **Security Assessment And Testing**: This domain focuses on security control testing, collecting and analyzing data and conducting security audits to monitor for risks, [[Threats|threats]] and vulnerabilities. For example, security analysts can do regular audits to check on users permissions or implement 2 factor authentication.
* **Security Operations**: This domain focuses on conducting investigations and implementing preventive measures.
* **Software Development Security**: This domain focuses on using secure code practices, which are a set of recommended guidelines that are used to create and maintain secure applications.


In the course, we will dive deep into the areas of each domain:

# Security and Risk Management:

* **Security goals and objectives**: Reduce risks to critical assets and data, like PII.
* **[[Risks|Risk]] mitigation**: The process of having the right procedures and rules in place to quickly reduce the impact of a risk like a breach.
* **Compliance**: The primary method used to develop an organization security policies, regulatory requirements and independent standards.
* **Business Continuity**: An organization's ability to maintain their everyday productivity by establishing [[Risks|risk]] disaster recovery plans.
* **Laws**: Laws are different in many parts of the world, however their goals is similar. That corresponds to maintain a posture that obey rules and have an ethical posture that minimizes fraud, negligence or fraud.


# Asset Security:

	Knowing what data you have, and who has access to it, is necessary for having a 
	strong security posture that mitigates risks to critical assets and data.

# Security Architecture and Engineering:

* **Shared Responsibility**: All individuals within an organization take an active role in lowering risk and maintaining both physical and virtual security.
* [[Threat]] Models;
* Minor Privilege;
* Deep Defense;
* Fail safe;
* Task Separation;
* Keep it simple;
* No trust;
* Believe, but verify;
# Identity and Access Management (IAM):
It has four core components:

* Identification;
* Authentication;
* Authorization;
* Accountability;
# Security Operations:

* Training and awareness;
* Reports and documentation;
* Detect and prevent incidents;
* SIEM tools;
* Log records management;
* Incidents management;
* Playbooks;
* Forensics post-attack;
* Reflexion on the lessons learned;
