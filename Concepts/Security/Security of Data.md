In data security, vulnerabilities are often mapped in one model known as **Life Cycle of Data**. Each stage in this cycle is part of an important function of security controls that are implemented to keep the CIA triad.

## The cycle

The cycle is an important model that security teams consider when protecting informations. It keeps influence in how teams define politics that will align with commercial goals.

In general, the model has five stages. Each describes how data flow from in one organization from the moment they're created to the moment they're **useless**:

- **Collection**
- **Storage**
- **Usage**
- **Archival**
- **Destruction**

## Data governance

Companies deal with huge amount of data everyday. New informations are collected from internal and external sources. One structured approach to manage all this data is the best way to keep them safe and private.

**Data governance** is a set of processes that define how an organization manages these informations. The governance will usually specify how to keep data private, precise, available and safe during all the life cycle.

**Data governance** is effective as a collective set of actions. The policies in data governance usually categorize the individuals in one specific function:

1. **Data owner**: The person who decides who can access, edit, use or destroy their own information.
2. **Data custodian**: Any person or entity that's responsible for the usage, transport and safe storage of the informations.
3. **Data administrator**: A person or group that keeps and implements **Data governance** established by an organization.

## Legally protected informations

In technical terms, data is nothing more than bits (0s and 1s) processed by a computer. However, these data can represent the thoughts, actions and choices made by someone. Individually, these objects represent nothing. When tied together, they can map the life of a person. For this reason, the **data owners** must be the only ones that can decide if they want to share their data or not.

The security of data can be quite hard. In part, it's because **data owners** generate more data that they can manage. This way, **data custodian** and **data administrators** do not have specific and clear instructions on how they must deal with certain kinds of data. Government agencies and other regulatory agencies fulfilled this role, creating rules that specify the data that companies must protect by default:

- **PII**: Personally Identifiable Information is any information used to infer someone else's identity. These are informations that are used to hire or find someone.
- **PHI**: Personal Health Information are informations related to the health or physical or mental condition, present, future or past, of an individual. This is the definition of the HIPAA, in the US. The UE and Brazil have similar law understanding among the same type of data.
- **SPII**: Sensitive Personally Identifiable Information is usually the most strict type of data, in the eyes of the law. It can only be accessed by a third party only in the exact moment they need to know and in any other moment. It can be the number of a bank account or login credentials.
