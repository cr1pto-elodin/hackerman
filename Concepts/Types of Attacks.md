As a pentester or a cyber security analyst, I need to understand the types of attacks and how they can be done.

First of all lest sumarize: [[#Phishing|Phishing]], [[#Malware|Malware]] and [[#Social Engineering|Social Engineering]].

# Phishing:

	Phishing is a kind of attack that uses digital communication
	channels to trick individuals and make them reveal confidential
	data or install malwares. Can be done as:

* **Business-to-business Compromise (BEC)**: An agent sends an email that seems to be from a trustful source, pretending to use the informantions to a good and useful purpose. Usually to gain access to financial informantions.
* **Spear phishing**: Attack that happens when an agent sends an email pretending to be a trustful source and targets one user or a group of users.
* **Whaling**: A type of spear phishing. The agents targets high executives from a company to obtain access to confidential data.
* **Vishing**: The exploit of electronic communication using voice to obtain confidential data or impersonate someone that can be trusted.
* **Smishing**: Similar to vishing, but using text messages instead.

# Malware:

	Malware is a type of software that is coded to damage computers or
	networks. The main goal is to obtain money or intel data that can 
	be used against a person, a company or a country. Can be coded as:

* **Virus**: A type of malware that is written to interfere with the operations of a computer. A virus can be downloaded by a naive user (or an external agent) that when executed, the file hides itself among other files. The main goal of a virus is to destroy or corrupt data inside a system.
* **Worms**: A malware that auto reproduces itself inside a network. It doesn't need to be downloaded by a user. Instead, it just needs to infect one system and then reproduces itself to contaminate all other devices.
* **Ransomware**: Malicious attack in which external agents encrypt data from a company and demand payment to restore the access.
* **Spyware**: Malware used to collect and sell information without consent. The spyware also can be used to access devices. 

# Social Engineering: 

	A technique that uses human error to obtain access to confidential
	data or physical spaces. Human error is usually the result of
	trusting someone without questioning. The mission of someone using
	this is to create a space of trust, with false confidence and lies
	to exploit the bigger number of people as possible.

* **Social media phishing**: Use the content that the target has available online inside its social media. 
* **Watering hole attack**: The attack is made to a website visited by a specific group of users.
* **Pshysical social engineering**: The attacker pretends to be an employer, a costumer or a supplier to gain access to certain locations.

	`Social engineering is highly effective. This happens because people are prone to trust and respect authority. The number of social engineering attacks is only growing with time and the number of new social medias. Posting locations, photos and even other personal data can be fun, it only becomes more risky.

	The reasons why social engineering is useful is:

* **Authority**: The agents pretends to be individuals with power. People are, usually, conditioned to follow orders from persons in power.
* **Intimidation**: They use intimidation to gain what they want. This includes persuade and intimidate. 
* **Consent/social prove**: The agent make an individual believe that is doing an action that others have done in the past, making it seem legitimate. For example, asks for permissions to a certain employer, saying that it had them in the past and others had given it to him.
* **Scarcity**: Tactic used to suggest that an item or service has its offer is limited.
* **Familiarity**: The agents establish a false emotional connection with users that can be exploited.
* **Trust**: The agent establish a false emotional connection with the target that is exploited over time. They use this kind of relationship to develop trust and gain personal information.
* **Urgency**: An agent persuades the target to answer its demands without questioning.
