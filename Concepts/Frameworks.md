Frameworks are guidelines that are used by a security team for building plans to mitigate risk and threats to data and privacy. It's a structure approach to implement the security life cycle. Also, this defines how a company manage risks, follow stablished guidelines and meet mandatory compliance, like laws.

Security frameworks purposes can be listed as:

* Protecting PII;
* Securing financial information;
* Identifying security weaknesses;
* Managing organizational risks;
* Aligning security with business goals;

Also, frameworks have four core components that will allow to understand how to manage risks:

* Identifying and documenting security goals;
* Setting guidelines to achieving security goals;
* Implementing strong security process;
* Monitoring and communicating results;

# CIA

The CIA triad are three foundational principles used by cybersecurity professionals to establish appropriate controls that mitigate risks and vulnerabilities. Each letter stands for a word and a focus:

 * Confidentiality;
 * Integrity;
 * Availability;

With that in mind, security controls are safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks. So, they are used alongside with frameworks to ensure that security goals and process are implemented correctly and that organizations meet regulatory compliance requirements.
