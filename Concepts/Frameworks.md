Frameworks are guidelines that are used by a security team for building plans to mitigate risk and threats to data and privacy. It's a structure approach to implement the security life cycle. Also, this defines how a company manage risks, follow stablished guidelines and meet mandatory compliance, like laws.

Security frameworks purposes can be listed as:

* Protecting PII;
* Securing financial information;
* Identifying security weaknesses;
* Managing organizational risks;
* Aligning security with business goals;

Also, frameworks have four core components that will allow to understand how to manage risks:

* Identifying and documenting security goals;
* Setting guidelines to achieving security goals;
* Implementing strong security process;
* Monitoring and communicating results;

# CIA

The CIA triad are three foundational principles used by cybersecurity professionals to establish appropriate controls that mitigate risks and vulnerabilities. Each letter stands for a word and a focus:

 * Confidentiality: Only authorized users can access specific assets or data;
 * Integrity: The data is correct, authentic and reliable;
 * Availability: Data is accessible to those who are authorized to use them.

With that in mind, security controls are safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks. So, they are used alongside with frameworks to ensure that security goals and process are implemented correctly and that organizations meet regulatory compliance requirements.

# Security Controls:

Security controls are safeguards to reduce specific security risks. Security controls examples can be listed as:

1. **Encryption**: The process of converting data from a readable format to an encoded format.
2. **Authentication**: The process of verifying who someone or something is.
3. **Biometric**: Unique physical characteristics that can be used to verify a person's identity.
4. **Authorization**: The concept of granting access to specific resources within a system.

## Controls Categories

Controls within cybersecurity can be grouped into three main categories:

1. **Administrative/Managerial controls**: address the human component of cybersecurity. These controls include policies and procedures that define ow an organization manages data and clearly defines employee responsibilities, including how they will protect the organization.
2. **Technical controls**: consists in software based solutions such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), antivirus (AV) products, encryption, etc.
3. **Physical controls**: these are the ones that treat physical access and permission to be in a certain space or to access a certain physical asset, such as a mainframe, for example. These controls can be listed as CCTV systems or even cabinet locks.

## Control Types

* **Preventative**: They are designed to prevent an incident.
* **Corrective**: They are used to restore an asset after an incident.
* **Detective**: They're used to determine if an incident has occurred or is in progress.
* **Deterrent**: They are designed to discourage attacks.
