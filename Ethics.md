It's important to understand that when dealing with PII and SPII, and the forms to secure it, the professional actions are aligned with the company policy and the law. 

For instance, consider the following scenario: a colleague was caught by you making a huge breach of data. It's your duty to remain calm and report it to your superiors.

It's necessary to follow some principles:

1. Confidentiality: Part of the [[Frameworks#CIA|CIA]] triad, it means that only authorized users can access specific assets or data.
2. Privacy protections: Safeguard personal information from unauthorized use.
3. Laws: Rules recognized by a community and enforced by a governing entity. (Remember Law School).

# US View on CounterAttacks

Following the above principles, it's necessary to understand that main goal of a ciber security professional is analyze and defend. Even tough ethical hackers exist, their main goal is not to make a real attack and destroy something. So, the main goal is always to defend and never counterattack.
In the US, for example, the act of counterattack a threat agent is consider as vigilantism. Which means that anyone or any agency that is not a part of law enforcement can not stop or punish a crime by using force on their own. Since, threat actors are criminals, counterattacks can lead to  escalation of the attack, which can cause even more damage and harm.
In other case, if the threat agent is a state-sponsored hacktivist, a counterattack can lead to serious international implications.
Some laws in the US, that condemn the act of counterattack a cyber attack: Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the Cybersecurity Sharing Act of 2015 (among others).

# International View on CounterAttacks

The International Court of Justice states that a person or a group can counterattack if:

* The counterattack will only affect the party that attacked first
* The counterattack is a direct communication asking the initial attacker to stop.
* The counterattack does not escalate the situation.
* The counterattack effects can be reversed.

Since the above scenarios and parameters are hard to mesure, organizations typically do not counterattack.
