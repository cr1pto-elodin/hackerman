The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) is a voluntary framework that consists of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk. There are five core component functions:

1. **Identify**: The management of cybersecurity risk and its effect on an organization's people and assets.
2. **Protect**: The strategy used to protect an organization through the implementation of policies, procedures, training and tools that help mitigate cybersecurity threats.
3. **Detect**: Identifying potential security incidents and improving monitoring capabilities to increase the speed and efficiency of detections.
4. **Respond**: Making sure that the proper procedures are used to contain, neutralize, and analyze security incidents, and implement improvements to the security process.
5. **Recover**: The process of retuning systems back to normal operation.
