Network protocols are a set of rules that are used by two or more devices in a network to describe the flow of communication: send and receive. 

Even tough the protocols are essential for devices to communicate with each other, cybersecurity analysts still need to understand the proper way to deal with security issues associated with them. For example, a threat actor could use the DNS protocol to change the traffic from a legitimate site to a malicious site that could contain all sorts of malware.

## Communication Protocols

The communication protocols can be found on the [[TCP IP]] text.

## Management Protocols

These are used to monitor and manage the activity inside a network. The TCP/IP for example is a **Management Protocol**.

### Simple Network Management Protocol

This is a network protocol used to monitor and manage devices in a network. The SNMP can redefine passwords in a device or change the base line configuration. It can also be used to send requests to the devices present in the network, with the objective of getting a report about the network bandwidth that's being used.

## Protocols lists and its ports
