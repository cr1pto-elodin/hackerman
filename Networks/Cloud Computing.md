Traditional networks are called on-premise networks, which means that all of the devices used for network operations are kept at a physical location owned by the company, like in an office building. 

**Cloud computing**, however, refers to the practice, of using remote servers, applications, and network services that are hosted on the internet of a physical location owned by the company.

A cloud service provider (CSP) is a company that offers cloud computing services. These companies own large data centers in locations around the globe that house millions of servers. Data centers provides technology services, such as storages, and compute at such a large scale that they can sell their services to other companies for a fee. Companies can pay for the storage and services they need and consume them through the CSP's application programming interface (API) or web console.

CSPs provides three main categories of services:

* **Software as a Service**: refers to software suites operated by the CSP that a company can use remotely without hosting the software.
* **Infrastructure as a Service**: refers to the use of virtual computer components offered by the CSP. These include containers and storage that are configured remotely through the CPS's API or web console.
* **Platform as a Service**: refers to tools that application developers can use to design custom applications for their company. Custom applications are designed and accessed in the cloud and used for a company's specific business needs.

## Hybrid Cloud Environments

When organizations use a CSP's services in addition to their on-premise computers, networks, and storage , it's referred to as a hybrid cloud environment. When organizations use more than one CSP, it's called a **multi-cloud** environment. The vast majority use hybrid environments to reduce costs and maintain control over network resources.

## Software-defined networks

CSPs offer networking tools similar to the physical devices. Software-devices networks (SDNs) are made up of virtual network devices and services. Just like CSPs provide virtual computers, many SDNs also provide switches, routers, firewalls and more. Most modern network hardware devices also support network virtualization and software-defined networking.

## Benefits of Cloud Computing

1. **Reliability**: This is based on how available cloud services and resources are, how secure connections are, and how often the services are effectively running. Cloud computing allows employees and customers to access the resources they need consistently and with minimal interruption.
2. **Cost**: Traditionally, companies have had to provide their own network infrastructure, at least for internet connections. This meant there could be potentially significant upfront costs for companies. However, because CSPs have such large data centers, they are able to offer virtual devices and services at a fraction of the cost required to install, patch, upgrade, and manage the components and software themselves.
3. **Scalability**: Another challenge that companies face with traditional computing is scalability. When organizations experience an increase in their business needs, they might be forced to buy more equipment and software to keep up. But what if business decreases shortly after? They might no longer have the business to justify the cost incurred by the upgraded components. CSPs reduce this risk by making it easy to consume services in an elastic utility model. This means companies only pay for what they need when they need it.
