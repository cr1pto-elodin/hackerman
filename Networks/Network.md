A network is a group of interconnected computer devices. They can be mobile phones, but they can also be tablets, notebooks or personal computers. There are many types of networks and network tools that are used to create the connection between multiple devices.

## Network devices

Network devices maintain information and services for users of a network. These devices connect over wired or wireless connection. After establishing a connection, to the network, the devices send data packets. The data packets provide information about the source and the destination of the data. 

### Devices and desktop computers

Most internet users are familiar with everyday devices, such as personal computers, laptops, mobile phones and tablets. Each device and desktop has a unique MAC address and IP address, which identify it on the network. They also have a network interface that sends and receives data packets. These devices can connect to the network via a hard wire or a wireless connection.

### Firewalls

A firewall is a network security device that monitors traffic to or from your network. Firewalls can also restrict specific incoming and outgoing network traffic. The organization sets the rule that will work on the firewalls. Note that they often reside between the secured and controlled internal network and the untrusted network resources outside the organization, such as the internet.

### Servers

Servers provide informations and services for devices like computers, smart home devices, and smartphones on the network. The devices that are connected to a server are called clients. 

### Hubs and switches

A **hub** is a device that provides a common point of connection for all devices connected to it. Hubs additionally repeat all information out to all ports. From a security perspective, this makes hubs vulnerable to eavesdropping. For this reason, hubs are commonly used for a limited network setup like a home office.

A **switch** forwards packets between devices directly connected to it. They analyze the destination address of each data packet and send it to the intended device. Switches maintain a MAC address table that matches MAC addresses of devices on the network to port numbers on the switch and forward incoming data packets according to the destination MAC address. 

**Switches** are part of the data link layer in the TCP/IP model.

### Routers

**Routers** connect networks and direct traffic, based on the IP address of the destination network. Routers allow devices on different networks to communicate with each other. In the TCP/IP model, routers are a part of the network layer. In the TCP/Ip model, routers are part of the network layer. 

**Routers** can also include a firewall feature that allows or block incoming traffic based on information on the transmission.

### Modems and wireless access points

#### Modems

Modems usually connect your home or office with an internet service provider. IPSs provides internet connectivity via telephone lines or coaxial cables. Modems receive transmission or digital signals from the internet and translate them into analog signals that can travel  through the physical connection provided by your ISP. Usually, modems connect to a router that takes the decoded transmissions and sends them to on the local network.

Note: Enterprise networks used by large organizations to connect their users and devices often use other broadband technologies to handle high-volume traffic, instead of using a modem.

#### Wireless Access Points

This device sends and receive digital signals over radio waves creating a wireless network. Devices with wireless adapters connect to the access point using Wi-Fi. Wi-Fi refers to a set of standards that are used by a network devices to communicate wirelessly. Wireless access points and the devices connected to them use Wi-Fi protocols to send data through radio waves where they are sent to routers and switches and directed along the path to their final destination.
