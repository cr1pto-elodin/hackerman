| Firewall                                      | A firewall blocks traffic based in a set of rules.                                                                                               | A firewall can only filter packets based on informations provided by the headers.                                                                                       |
| Intrusion Detection System (IDS)              | An IDS detects and alerts admins about possible intrusions, attacks and malicious traffic.                                                       | An IDS can only detect known attacks and obvious threats; new and sophisticated attacks may not be detected. Also, the IDS doesn't stop any kind of suspicious action.  |
| Sistema de prevenção de intrusão (IPS)        | An IPS monitors system activity searching for intrusions and suspicious behavior, taking measures when finding them.                             | If an IPS fails, all the connection between the private network and the Internet will be interrupted. It can also detect false positives and blocks legitimate traffic. |
| Security Information and Event Manager (SIEM) | A SIEM tool colect and analyses data of many devices in the network. It aggregates logs about the events in dashboards, to better visualization. | A SIEM tool only reports suspicious behavior. It doesn't take any action to stop or avoid them.                                                                         |
