A playbook is a manual that provides details about any operational action. Essentially, a playbook provides a predefined and up-to-date list of steps to perform when responding to an incident.

Playbooks are accompanied by a strategy. The strategy outlines expectations of team members who are assigned a task, and some playbooks also list the individuals responsible. The outlined expectations are accompanied by a plan. The plan dictates how the specific task outlined in the playbook must be completed.

Playbooks should be treated as living documents, which means that they are frequently updated by security team members to address industry changes and new threats. Playbooks are generally managed as a collaborative effort, since security team members have different levels of expertise.

Updates are often made if:

* A failure is identified, such as an oversight in the outlined policies and procedures, or in the playbook itself.
* There is a change in industry standards, such as changes in laws or regulatory compliance.
* The cyber security landscape changes due to evolving threat actor tactics and techniques.

Playbooks sometimes are often created to treat specific scenarios. For example, if a threat actor made a ransomware attack, some companies have a procedure that the analysts will have to follow. 
Each organization has its own set of playbooks, tools, methodologies, protocols and procedures that they adhere to, and different individuals are involved at each step of the response process, depending on the country they're in.
